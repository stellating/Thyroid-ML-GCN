# ML-GCN.pytorch
Medical image application of ML-GCN. [Multi-Label Image Recognition with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03582), CVPR 2019.

### Requirements
Please, install the following packages
- numpy
- torch-0.3.1
- torchnet
- torchvision-0.2.0
- tqdm

### Options
- `lr`: learning rate
- `lrp`: factor for learning rate of pretrained layers. The learning rate of the pretrained layers is `lr * lrp`
- `batch-size`: number of images per batch
- `image-size`: size of the image
- `epochs`: number of training epochs
- `evaluate`: evaluate model on validation set
- `resume`: path to checkpoint

### Demo COCO 2014
```sh
python3 demo_coco_gcn.py data/coco --image-size 448 --batch-size 32 -e --resume checkpoint/coco/coco_checkpoint.pth.tar
```
